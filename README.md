OSX Dotfiles

This repo contains my OSX dotfiles. Inspiration taken from this [blog](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/)

To set up a new machine simply run the following command which will download a bash install script stored as a GitHub gist and run it:

    curl -Lks https://gist.github.com/jpenglert/ad4f5f069d85e205cd2dd20cf9732260 | /bin/bash
